Q28: **What causes kidney stones and how can I prevent them?**

A28: Kidney stones form when minerals and salts in urine crystallize.  Risk factors include dehydration, high sodium intake, excessive consumption of animal protein (especially red meat), obesity, diets rich in oxalate (spinach, nuts, chocolate), inadequate dietary calcium, certain medical conditions (urinary tract infections, inflammatory bowel disease), and some medications.  To reduce your risk, drink plenty of water (aim for at least two to three liters per day unless your doctor advises otherwise), limit salt and animal protein, maintain a healthy weight, consume adequate calcium from food (not supplements), and address underlying health issues with your doctor.  People with a history of stones should discuss specific dietary modifications with a healthcare professional.

Q69: **What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?**

A69: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the insulin‑producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to an absolute insulin deficiency.  It often develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy.  Type 2 diabetes results from insulin resistance and a gradual decline in insulin production, commonly associated with excess weight, sedentary lifestyle, and genetics.  It usually occurs in adults but is increasingly seen in younger people.  Management includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, weight loss if needed, and sometimes oral medications or insulin.

Q70: **How can I prevent or manage prediabetes?**

A70: Prediabetes is a warning sign that blood glucose levels are elevated but not yet in the diabetes range.  Preventing or reversing prediabetes involves adopting healthy lifestyle habits: achieve and maintain a healthy weight, engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week, choose high‑fiber foods and whole grains over refined carbohydrates, limit added sugars and saturated fats, and avoid smoking.  Regular screening and working with a healthcare provider or diabetes educator can help monitor progress and prevent progression to type 2 diabetes.

Q71: **What is metabolic syndrome?**

A71: Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of conditions that occur together and increase the risk for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.  It includes abdominal obesity (large waist circumference), high blood pressure, elevated fasting blood glucose, high triglycerides, and low HDL (“good”) cholesterol.  Having three or more of these factors constitutes metabolic syndrome.  Lifestyle changes—healthy eating, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation—are the cornerstone of prevention and management.

Q85: **What are hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and how do I manage them?**

A85: Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) can cause increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and headache.  Management includes taking prescribed medication, staying hydrated, monitoring blood glucose levels, and engaging in physical activity if appropriate.  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may cause shakiness, sweating, confusion, irritability, or fainting.  Quickly treat hypoglycemia by consuming 15–20 grams of fast‑acting carbohydrates (e.g., 4 oz of fruit juice or regular soda, glucose tablets, or hard candies) and recheck blood sugar after 15 minutes.  Follow up with a snack containing complex carbohydrates and protein once blood sugar returns to normal.  Seek medical advice if episodes are frequent or severe.
