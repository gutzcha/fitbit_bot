Q34: **What is HPV and why should I get vaccinated?**

A34: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 100 viruses transmitted through intimate skin‑to‑skin contact.  Certain strains cause genital warts, and others are linked to cancers of the cervix, anus, throat, penis, and vagina.  Most infections clear spontaneously, but persistent infection with high‑risk types can lead to cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against the most dangerous strains.  It is recommended for preteens (around ages 11–12) but can be given up to age 26 (and sometimes up to 45).  Vaccination is a safe and effective way to reduce the risk of HPV‑related diseases.

Q54: **What causes low libido and how can I improve it?**

A54: Low sex drive can result from stress, relationship issues, hormonal imbalances (including low testosterone), medications, chronic illness, fatigue, or mental health problems.  Ways to improve libido include open communication with your partner, stress reduction, regular exercise, enough sleep, limiting alcohol and quitting smoking, and addressing any underlying health conditions with your doctor.  In some cases, hormonal therapy or counseling may be recommended.
