Target Heart Rate Zones for Exercise

Your heart rate during exercise reflects how hard your body is working. To estimate your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. For example, a 30‑year‑old would have an estimated maximum heart rate of about 190 beats per minute (bpm). Exercising within a target heart rate zone helps you maximise the benefits of your workouts safely.

- **Moderate-Intensity Zone:** About 50 % to 70 % of your maximum heart rate. Activities in this zone include brisk walking, light cycling or water aerobics. This zone improves basic endurance and burns fat. If you are new to exercise or returning after a break, begin at the lower end of this range and build up gradually.

- **Vigorous-Intensity Zone:** About 70 % to 85 % of your maximum heart rate. Activities in this zone include running, fast cycling, swimming laps or high‑intensity interval training. Working out in this range improves cardiorespiratory fitness and can lead to greater improvements in performance and caloric burn. Use this zone once you have a fitness base and are comfortable with more intense workouts.

Approximate Heart Rate Zones by Age

This table shows the target heart rate ranges (50 % to 85 % of maximum) and the age‑predicted maximum heart rates for different ages.

Age | Target HR Zone (50–85 %) | Approx. Maximum HR
---|---|---
20 years | 100–170 bpm | 200 bpm
30 years | 95–162 bpm | 190 bpm
35 years | 93–157 bpm | 185 bpm
40 years | 90–153 bpm | 180 bpm
45 years | 88–149 bpm | 175 bpm
50 years | 85–145 bpm | 170 bpm
55 years | 83–140 bpm | 165 bpm
60 years | 80–136 bpm | 160 bpm
65 years | 78–132 bpm | 155 bpm
70 years | 75–128 bpm | 150 bpm

Tips for Heart Rate Training

- Start in the lower part of your zone (around 50 % of maximum) if you are new to exercise, then gradually work toward the middle and upper ranges as your fitness improves.
- Wear a heart rate monitor or use a fitness tracker to check your heart rate during workouts. If you do not have one, you can take your pulse manually by counting the beats at your wrist or neck for 30 seconds and doubling that number to get bpm.
- Some medications and medical conditions can affect your heart rate. Consult your doctor to determine the best heart rate targets for your situation.
- Listen to your body. If your heart rate is too high and the exercise feels very hard, slow down or take a rest. If the intensity feels light and your heart rate is low, you can safely increase your effort.
