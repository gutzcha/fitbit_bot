Q1: **What is a normal resting heart rate for adults?**

A1: For most healthy adults, a resting heart rate between **60 and 100 beats per minute** is considered normal.  Highly fit individuals (such as endurance athletes) often have lower resting heart rates, sometimes in the 40s or 50s, because their hearts pump blood more efficiently.  Persistent resting rates above 100 bpm (tachycardia) or unusually low rates in non‑athletes should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Q7: **What is a healthy blood pressure?**

A7: Blood pressure is recorded as **systolic pressure over diastolic pressure**.  The American Heart Association defines **normal blood pressure** as less than **120/80 mm Hg**.  *Elevated* blood pressure means a systolic pressure of **120–129 mm Hg** with diastolic still under 80.  *Hypertension* Stage 1 is **130–139/80–89 mm Hg**, Stage 2 is **140 mm Hg or higher systolic or 90 mm Hg or higher diastolic**, and a *hypertensive crisis* (above 180/120 mm Hg) requires immediate medical care.  Regular monitoring and lifestyle changes such as reducing sodium intake, being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol can help control blood pressure.

Q8: **What is a normal oxygen saturation level?**

A8: Blood oxygen saturation (SpO₂) measures the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen.  Normal SpO₂ readings for healthy adults typically range from **95 % to 100 %**.  Readings consistently below 90 % are considered low and warrant evaluation by a healthcare professional, as they may indicate respiratory or cardiovascular problems.  Factors such as cold extremities, poor circulation, or nail polish can affect pulse‑oximeter accuracy.

Q10: **How can I improve my sleep quality?**

A10: Good sleep hygiene includes keeping a consistent sleep schedule (aim for 7–9 hours of sleep per night), creating a comfortable and cool sleeping environment, and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine.  Avoid large meals, caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol in the evening.  Limit screen time and bright light before bed, and reserve the bedroom for sleep and intimacy.  Exercise regularly but not right before bedtime.  If you can’t fall asleep after about 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy.  Managing stress through journaling or meditation and seeking help for underlying sleep disorders can also improve sleep.

Q18: **How can I improve my sleep if I work night shifts or have an irregular schedule?**

A18: Night‑shift workers should strive to keep a consistent sleep schedule even on off‑days, create a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment (blackout curtains, white‑noise machines), and avoid caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals several hours before bedtime.  Wearing blue‑light‑blocking glasses and limiting screen exposure before sleep can help.  Short naps (≤30 minutes) earlier in the day may improve alertness without interfering with nighttime sleep.  Seeking exposure to bright daylight during waking hours can help synchronize circadian rhythms.

Q19: **What is the difference between moderate and vigorous exercise?**

A19: Moderate exercise raises your heart rate and breathing but still allows you to hold a conversation.  Examples include brisk walking, water aerobics, casual dancing, gardening, and doubles tennis.  Vigorous exercise requires greater effort; you breathe harder and can only speak a few words at a time.  Examples include running, lap swimming, hiking uphill, vigorous aerobic dance, singles tennis, heavy yardwork, and cycling faster than 10 mph.  Using a heart‑rate monitor or perceived‑exertion scale can help gauge intensity.

Q20: **How can I increase my VO₂ max?**

A20: VO₂ max improves with aerobic training, particularly high‑intensity interval training (HIIT), tempo runs, hill repeats, and long endurance sessions.  Gradually increase workout intensity, incorporate intervals (e.g., 3–5 minutes at a hard pace followed by equal‑length recovery), and include rest days to allow adaptation.  Strength training and flexibility work support overall fitness.  Consistency over weeks and months is key; expect measurable improvements after several weeks.

Q21: **How much sleep do adults need?**

A21: Most adults require **7–9 hours of sleep per night** for optimal health.  Getting too little sleep (fewer than 7 hours) impairs cognitive function, mood, immune health, and metabolic regulation.  Sleeping more than 9 hours regularly without feeling refreshed may signal an underlying medical issue.  Both sleep quantity and quality matter—aim to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep throughout the night, and wake up feeling rested.

Q25: **When should I seek medical attention for abnormal vital signs?**

A25: Seek immediate medical care if you experience resting heart rates consistently above 100 bpm (especially with shortness of breath or chest pain); blood pressure readings exceeding **180/120 mm Hg**; oxygen saturation below **90 %** not attributable to sensor error; or a fever above **103 °F (39.4 °C)** accompanied by severe symptoms.  Also consult a healthcare provider if you have repeated abnormal readings, unexplained changes in weight or appetite, persistent fatigue, or any symptom that concerns you.  Wearable devices can alert you to potential issues but do not replace professional evaluation.

Q25: **What causes bloating and how can I reduce it?**

A25: Bloating is often caused by excess gas and slow digestion.  Contributing factors include eating too quickly, drinking carbonated beverages, consuming high‑sodium or sugary foods, eating large meals, constipation, lactose intolerance, and gas‑producing foods like beans, cruciferous vegetables, and onions.  To reduce bloating, drink plenty of water, eat slowly, limit fizzy drinks and chewing gum, reduce salt and highly processed foods, add fiber gradually, incorporate probiotic‑rich foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut), and stay active to promote digestion.

Q26: **What causes nausea and how can I manage it?**

A26: Nausea has many possible causes, including motion sickness, migraine, pregnancy, gastrointestinal infections (stomach flu), stress or anxiety, overeating, and certain medications.  To manage nausea, avoid known triggers, eat small and bland meals (e.g., toast, bananas, rice), sip clear liquids or ginger tea, rest in a comfortable position, and get fresh air.  If nausea is severe, persistent, accompanied by vomiting lasting more than a day, or associated with other worrying symptoms (such as chest pain, severe headache, or fever), seek medical care.

Q27: **How long does food poisoning last and what are its symptoms?**

A27: Food poisoning symptoms—nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and headache—usually develop within hours to a day after eating contaminated food.  In most cases, symptoms resolve within **12–48 hours**, though some infections can last longer.  Rest and plenty of fluids are essential to prevent dehydration.  If symptoms are severe, persist beyond a few days, or include high fever, bloody stools, or signs of dehydration, contact a healthcare provider.

Q29: **What causes low blood pressure and when should I see a doctor?**

A29: Low blood pressure (hypotension) is generally defined as systolic pressure below **90 mm Hg** or diastolic below **60 mm Hg**.  Causes include dehydration, blood loss, heart problems, severe infection (sepsis), endocrine disorders, pregnancy, certain medications, and standing up quickly (orthostatic hypotension).  Symptoms may include dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, nausea, fatigue, and cold, clammy skin.  Mild low blood pressure may not require treatment beyond hydration and slow position changes.  Seek medical attention if low blood pressure is persistent, causes frequent fainting, or occurs alongside chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain.

Q30: **How can I stop snoring?**

A30: Snoring happens when airflow causes tissues in the throat to vibrate during sleep.  Lifestyle strategies that may reduce snoring include maintaining a healthy weight, sleeping on your side instead of your back, elevating the head of your bed, treating nasal congestion with saline sprays or nasal strips, avoiding alcohol and sedatives in the evening, quitting smoking, and practicing mouth and throat exercises to strengthen airway muscles.  Persistent snoring may signal obstructive sleep apnea; consult a healthcare provider if lifestyle changes do not help or if you experience gasping, choking, or excessive daytime sleepiness.

Q31: **How long is strep throat contagious?**

A31: Strep throat is caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria.  Without treatment, an infected person can remain contagious for about **two to three weeks** even if symptoms improve.  After starting appropriate antibiotics, most people are no longer contagious within **24 hours**.  To prevent spreading the infection, avoid close contact and stay home from work or school until you have been fever‑free for at least 12–24 hours and have taken antibiotics for at least a day.

Q32: **How long does the flu last and what are its symptoms?**

A32: Influenza symptoms—fever, chills, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue—typically develop suddenly.  Most healthy adults recover within **3–7 days**, although fatigue and cough can linger for a week or two.  Rest, fluids, and over‑the‑counter medications can help relieve symptoms; antiviral medications are most effective when started within 48 hours of onset and may shorten illness by a day or two.  Seek medical attention for severe symptoms, difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever, or if you are at high risk for complications (young children, seniors, pregnant women, or those with chronic conditions).

Q33: **What are the symptoms of long COVID?**

A33: Long COVID refers to lingering symptoms that persist for weeks or months after a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, even after the virus has cleared.  Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, cognitive difficulties ("brain fog"), headaches, muscle or joint pain, sleep disturbances, anxiety or depression, and changes in taste or smell.  Symptoms can fluctuate and vary widely.  If you suspect long COVID, consult a healthcare provider who can evaluate your condition and recommend appropriate rehabilitation and management strategies.

Q35: **What causes acne in adults and how can I treat it?**

A35: Adult acne can be triggered by hormonal fluctuations, stress, use of comedogenic cosmetics, certain medications, or dietary factors.  Management includes gentle cleansing twice daily, using non‑comedogenic products, topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or retinoids, and in some cases hormonal therapy for women (birth control pills or anti‑androgen medications).  Avoid picking or squeezing pimples, which can cause scarring.  If over‑the‑counter treatments don’t help, consult a dermatologist for prescription options.

Q36: **Why am I always tired?**

A36: Persistent fatigue can stem from multiple factors: inadequate or poor‑quality sleep, an unbalanced diet, inactivity, chronic stress, depression or anxiety, medical conditions (e.g., anemia, thyroid disorders, diabetes), medications, or overconsumption of alcohol or caffeine.  To combat fatigue, ensure you get 7–9 hours of sleep, adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, engage in regular physical activity, manage stress through relaxation techniques, limit alcohol and caffeine, and see a healthcare provider to rule out underlying medical causes if fatigue persists.

Q46: **What are the symptoms of a heart attack and what should I do?**

A46: Symptoms of a heart attack (myocardial infarction) include chest pressure or pain (often described as squeezing or fullness), discomfort that spreads to the arms, shoulder, neck, jaw, or back, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and cold sweats.  Women may experience atypical symptoms such as fatigue, indigestion, or pain in the upper back or jaw.  If you suspect a heart attack, call emergency services immediately.  Do not drive yourself to the hospital.  Early treatment can save heart muscle and lives.

Q47: **Why am I losing hair and how can I treat it?**

A47: Hair loss can be due to genetics (male or female pattern baldness), hormonal changes, stress, thyroid disorders, iron deficiency, autoimmune diseases, or certain medications.  Treatment depends on the cause.  Over‑the‑counter minoxidil may help with pattern baldness, while addressing nutritional deficiencies or managing stress can reverse some forms of hair loss.  If you notice sudden or patchy hair loss, consult a healthcare provider or dermatologist to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Q48: **How can I support my bone health?**

A48: To promote strong bones, consume adequate **calcium** (1,000–1,200 mg per day) from dairy products, fortified plant milks, leafy greens, and calcium‑rich foods.  Ensure sufficient **vitamin D** (600–800 IU per day), obtained through sunlight, fortified foods, or supplements if needed.  Engage in weight‑bearing and resistance exercises (walking, running, dancing, strength training), avoid smoking, limit alcohol, and maintain a healthy body weight.  Discuss bone‑density testing and preventive strategies with your healthcare provider, especially after age 50.

Q53: **When should I see a doctor about a mole?**

A53: Monitor moles using the **ABCDE rule**: **A**symmetry (one half doesn’t match the other), **B**order irregularity (edges are ragged or blurred), **C**olor variation (shades of tan, brown, black, red, white, or blue), **D**iameter larger than about **6 mm** (the size of a pencil eraser), and **E**volution (any change in size, shape, color, elevation, or new symptoms like bleeding or itching).  If a mole meets any of these criteria or looks different from your other moles, have it evaluated by a dermatologist.

Q55: **How can I boost my immune system?**

A55: The immune system functions best when supported by overall healthy living.  Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats; get regular physical activity; maintain a healthy weight; sleep 7–9 hours each night; manage stress through relaxation techniques; stay hydrated; avoid smoking; limit alcohol; and stay up to date on recommended vaccinations.  Supplements like vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may help if you have a deficiency, but they are not a substitute for healthy habits.

Q64: **How can I protect my eyes when using screens?**

A64: Practice the **20‑20‑20 rule**—every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds—to reduce eye strain.  Adjust screen brightness and contrast, position screens at arm’s length and slightly below eye level, use proper lighting to minimize glare, blink frequently to keep eyes moist, and take regular breaks from screens.  Consider using blue‑light‑filtering glasses or enabling night mode on devices.  Have regular eye exams to monitor vision and eye health.

Q65: **How can I maintain healthy skin?**

A65: To keep skin healthy, apply **broad‑spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher)** daily, even on cloudy days; cleanse gently with a mild cleanser; moisturize regularly to maintain the skin barrier; eat a diet rich in antioxidants (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds); stay hydrated; avoid smoking and limit alcohol; get adequate sleep; and manage stress.  Use products appropriate for your skin type and avoid harsh scrubs.  See a dermatologist for persistent skin concerns or signs of skin cancer.

Q66: **What are the signs of dehydration and how can I prevent it?**

A66: Early signs of dehydration include increased thirst, dry mouth, dark‑colored urine, decreased urine output, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion.  Severe dehydration can cause rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, and fainting.  To prevent dehydration, drink water regularly throughout the day; increase fluid intake in hot weather, during physical activity, or when ill; include water‑rich foods like fruits and vegetables in your diet; and limit alcohol and high‑sugar beverages, which can contribute to fluid loss.

Q67: **How do I know if my sore throat is strep?**

A67: Strep throat often presents with sudden severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen lymph nodes without cough or runny nose.  White patches on the tonsils may be visible.  Viral sore throats typically include cough, congestion, runny nose, and a gradual onset.  Only a healthcare provider can confirm strep through a rapid antigen test or throat culture.  Antibiotics treat strep throat, whereas viral infections resolve with rest and symptomatic care.

Q68: **When should I get my cholesterol checked?**

A68: Many guidelines recommend that adults have their cholesterol checked every 4–6 years starting at age 20, or more frequently if you have risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, or a family history of early heart disease.  Regular screening helps detect elevated LDL (“bad” cholesterol) and allows you and your healthcare provider to develop lifestyle or medical interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Q72: **When should I get screened for colon cancer?**

A72: For individuals at average risk, regular screening for colorectal cancer typically begins at age 45.  Screening options include stool‑based tests (e.g., fecal immunochemical test or FIT, stool DNA test) every 1–3 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, or colonoscopy every 10 years.  People with risk factors—such as a family history of colorectal cancer, certain genetic conditions, or inflammatory bowel disease—may need to start earlier and screen more often.  Discuss the best screening strategy with your healthcare provider.

Q73: **How can I relieve back pain?**

A73: Most acute back pain improves within a few weeks.  To relieve discomfort, stay as active as possible (avoid prolonged bed rest), apply heat or ice as needed, maintain good posture, and perform gentle stretching and strengthening exercises to build core and back muscles.  Over‑the‑counter pain relievers may help, but consult a doctor before prolonged use.  Seek medical advice if pain persists beyond a few weeks or if it radiates down the leg, causes numbness or weakness, or follows a fall or injury.

Q74: **How can I improve my posture?**

A74: Good posture involves aligning your head, shoulders, spine, and hips.  To improve posture, strengthen your core, back, and shoulder muscles through exercises like planks, bridges, and rows; adjust your workstation so your monitor is at eye level and your feet are flat on the floor; use a chair with lumbar support; avoid slouching or hunching over devices; and take regular breaks to stand, stretch, and move.  Practicing yoga or Pilates can also enhance body awareness and alignment.

Q75: **What is the difference between a cold and the flu?**

A75: The common cold and the flu are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses, but influenza is typically more severe.  Cold symptoms usually develop gradually and include runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, mild sore throat, and cough.  Flu symptoms come on abruptly and can include high fever, chills, body aches, severe fatigue, headache, and dry cough.  The flu can lead to complications such as pneumonia, especially in high‑risk groups.  Annual flu vaccination helps prevent infection.

Q76: **How can I treat a cold?**

A76: There is no cure for the common cold, but you can relieve symptoms by resting, staying hydrated, using saline nasal sprays or decongestants, gargling with warm salt water, and taking over‑the‑counter pain relievers or throat lozenges.  Honey may soothe a cough (but should not be given to children under one year old).  Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like the common cold.  See a healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 10 days.

Q84: **What is an autoimmune disease?**

A84: An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, organs, or cells.  Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.  Symptoms vary by condition but may include fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and organ dysfunction.  Treatment focuses on managing symptoms, reducing inflammation, and preserving organ function, often through medications and lifestyle modifications.

Q92: **How can I manage migraines?**

A92: Migraine triggers vary but often include stress, lack of sleep, certain foods (aged cheese, processed meats), alcohol, and hormonal changes.  To manage migraines, keep a headache diary to identify triggers, maintain regular sleep and meal schedules, stay hydrated, exercise regularly, and practice stress‑reduction techniques.  Over‑the‑counter pain relievers may help if taken early.  For frequent or severe migraines, consult a healthcare provider about preventive medications and other therapies.

Q93: **How can I treat constipation?**

A93: To relieve constipation, increase dietary fiber (from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans), drink plenty of water, and engage in regular physical activity.  Establish a consistent bathroom routine, and don’t delay the urge to go.  Over‑the‑counter stool softeners or fiber supplements can help, but consult a healthcare provider if constipation persists, is accompanied by pain, blood in stools, or unexplained weight loss.

Q95: **What is BMI and how is it calculated?**

A95: Body mass index (BMI) is a screening tool that estimates body fat based on height and weight.  Calculate BMI by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (BMI = kg/m²).  Categories include underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25–29.9), and obese (≥ 30).  BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat, so athletic individuals may have a high BMI but low body fat.  Use BMI alongside other measurements such as waist circumference and body composition.

Q100: **What is orthostatic hypotension and how can I manage it?**

A100: Orthostatic (postural) hypotension occurs when blood pressure drops significantly upon standing, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.  Causes include dehydration, prolonged bed rest, medications, and certain neurological or cardiovascular conditions.  Management strategies include rising slowly from sitting or lying positions, drinking enough fluids, wearing compression stockings, avoiding long periods of standing, and discussing medication adjustments with your healthcare provider.  If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical evaluation.
