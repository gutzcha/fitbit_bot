Q56: **What is postpartum recovery like and how can I support it?**

A56: After giving birth, a woman’s body undergoes healing and hormonal changes.  Expect vaginal bleeding and discharge (lochia) for up to six weeks, uterine contractions, sore breasts, and mood fluctuations.  To support recovery, rest as much as possible, eat nutritious meals, stay hydrated, gradually resume physical activity (starting with gentle walks and pelvic‑floor exercises), and seek social support.  Follow your healthcare provider’s advice on wound care if you had a C‑section or episiotomy.  Monitor for signs of postpartum depression or infection and seek medical help if needed.

Q57: **What exercises are safe during pregnancy?**

A57: Most healthy pregnant women can do **moderate‑intensity** exercise for at least **150 minutes per week**.  Safe options include walking, swimming, stationary cycling, prenatal yoga, and low‑impact aerobics.  Avoid high‑risk activities such as contact sports, scuba diving, or exercises with a high risk of falling.  Stay hydrated, avoid overheating, listen to your body, and consult your healthcare provider before starting or continuing an exercise program.  Stop exercising and seek medical advice if you experience vaginal bleeding, dizziness, chest pain, or contractions.

Q58: **What are the symptoms of menopause and how can I manage them?**

A58: Menopause marks the end of menstrual cycles, typically occurring around age 50.  Symptoms may include hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, mood swings, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, and weight gain.  Management strategies include dressing in layers, using fans or cooling products, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, managing stress, and limiting hot or spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol.  Some women benefit from hormone therapy or non‑hormonal medications; discuss options with a healthcare provider.  Regular checkups remain important to monitor bone density and cardiovascular health.

Q59: **What are the early signs of pregnancy?**

A59: Common early pregnancy signs include a missed period, tender or swollen breasts, fatigue, nausea or vomiting (morning sickness), increased urination, mild cramping or spotting, mood swings, and food cravings or aversions.  Not all women experience the same symptoms.  Take a home pregnancy test if you suspect pregnancy and consult a healthcare provider to confirm.

Q60: **What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and how is it treated?**

A60: PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age.  It is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound.  Symptoms can include weight gain, acne, thinning hair, and difficulty conceiving.  Treatment focuses on lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management), hormonal birth control to regulate periods, medications like metformin to improve insulin sensitivity, and fertility treatments if needed.  Early diagnosis and management reduce the risk of complications such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
