Q61: **What is a prostate exam and why is it important?**

A61: A prostate exam usually refers to a digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate‑specific antigen (PSA) blood test.  These tests help detect prostate enlargement, inflammation, or cancer.  Screening recommendations vary, but many guidelines suggest that men begin discussing prostate‑cancer screening with their doctor around age **50** (or earlier for those at higher risk due to family history or being of African descent).  Early detection improves treatment outcomes.

Q62: **What causes erectile dysfunction and how is it treated?**

A62: Erectile dysfunction (ED) can result from physical factors—such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hormonal imbalances, certain medications, and neurological disorders—or psychological factors like stress, anxiety, and depression.  Lifestyle modifications (regular exercise, weight loss, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol), psychological counseling, and managing underlying health conditions often help.  Medications such as phosphodiesterase‑5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) are commonly prescribed.  In some cases, vacuum devices, injections, or surgery may be recommended.  Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

Q63: **How can I increase testosterone naturally?**

A63: To support healthy testosterone levels, engage in regular strength training and high‑intensity interval workouts, get **7–9 hours of sleep** per night, maintain a healthy body weight, eat a balanced diet rich in proteins, healthy fats (e.g., from olive oil, avocados, nuts), and micronutrients like vitamin D and zinc, manage stress through relaxation techniques, and limit alcohol consumption.  Testosterone replacement therapy should only be considered under medical supervision for men with clinically low levels.
