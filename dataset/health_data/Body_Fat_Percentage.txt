Body Fat Percentage and Health

Body fat percentage measures the proportion of your weight that comes from fat tissue. Unlike body mass index (BMI), which simply relates weight to height, body fat percentage gives a better picture of body composition and can help identify potential risks for obesity‑related health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes.

Typical Body Fat Ranges for Adults

For non‑athletic adults, body fat percentage tends to be higher in women than in men. The following ranges are considered typical for generally healthy, non‑athletic adults:

- **Men:** About 18 % to 24 % body fat is typical. Values below this range are more common in athletes, while values above may indicate overweight or higher fat levels.
- **Women:** About 25 % to 31 % body fat is typical. Values below this range are more common in athletes. Higher values may suggest overweight or increased body fat.

Average Body Fat Percentages in the United States

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show the average body fat percentages among adults in the United States:

- **Men (20 and older):** Average around 28.1 %. Young adult men (20–39) have an average around 26.1 %, while men aged 40–59 average about 28.6 %.
- **Women (20 and older):** Average around 39.8 %. Young adult women (20–39) average around 37.8 %, and women aged 40–59 average about 40.5 %.

Classifying Body Fat Levels

A 2025 study that examined healthy weight ranges based on body fat suggested the following thresholds for overweight and obesity:

- **Overweight:** Body fat of 25 % or more in males or 36 % or more in females.
- **Obesity:** Body fat of 30 % or more in males or 42 % or more in females.

These thresholds are guidelines. The optimal body fat percentage for you depends on genetics, age, hormonal status and fitness goals. For example, endurance athletes often maintain lower body fat percentages to improve performance, while people with certain medical conditions may need higher body fat for safety and energy reserves.

Measuring Body Fat

Body fat percentage can be estimated using several methods, ranging from simple at‑home techniques to sophisticated clinical tests:

- **Waist and hip measurements:** Ratios such as waist‑to‑hip and waist‑to‑height provide insight into fat distribution.
- **Skinfold calipers:** A health professional measures the thickness of skinfolds at various sites to estimate subcutaneous fat.
- **Hydrostatic (underwater) weighing or air‑displacement plethysmography:** These methods determine body density to estimate fat percentage and are considered accurate but may not be widely available.
- **Dual‑energy X‑ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans:** DEXA uses X‑rays to differentiate between bone, muscle and fat and provides a precise measurement of body composition.
- **Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA):** A small electrical current travels through the body to estimate fat and lean mass. Many consumer scales use this method.

No measurement is perfectly precise, and body fat percentage is just one marker of health. Factors such as muscle mass, bone density, hormonal status and genetics all influence body composition. Maintaining an active lifestyle, eating a balanced diet and consulting with healthcare professionals can help you reach a healthy body fat range for your individual needs.
