Spread protein intake evenly across meals to maximize muscle protein synthesis.  Choose high‑quality sources such as lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, and soy products.  Combine adequate protein with strength training and sufficient calorie intake for best results.\\n\\nQ91: **How can I prepare for a 5K run?**\\n\\nA91: A gradual training plan helps you complete a 5K safely.  Start with a combination of walking and running (e.g., run for 1 minute, walk for 2 minutes) and slowly increase the running intervals while reducing walking intervals over 6–8 weeks.  Plan three training sessions per week, include rest days, and cross‑train with strength or flexibility exercises.  Wear well‑fitting shoes, warm up before each session, and cool down afterward.')]"
